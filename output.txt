  is often used interchangeably with personalized . The definitions of both are not as tight as one would hope and mean slightly different things to different people. The preference to use  rather than personalized seems to be getting stronger because it suggests that the right treatment will be chosen from among multiple options based on the detailed molecular nature of the disease. Some people feel that personalized  suggests that new therapies will be developed for each person, which is not typically going to happen.

Cancer is one of the best examples of   because there are now many treatments directed at specific molecular targets. They can be highly effective against cancers in which those genes are altered. Assigning a molecular basis to each person’s cancer allows more effective therapy than basing it on tissue of origin.

With monogenic disorders, the first goal is to identify the gene that causes the disease. This is more easily done now than it used to be because of the ability to examine the whole genome or exome. Once the gene and specific problem is known, decisions on therapies, if any, can be made.

I'll help get this rolling - first, let's be lumpers rather than splitters: I think our field is being more intellectually honest than ever before by admitting that a lot of  is "imprecise" or even "empiric", based on trial and error or observation rather than actual mechanisms of health or disease. I would suggest that " " is a trendy colloquial term which refers to the linkage of medical care to a robust, deep, validated identification and targeting of the disease biology. I like the splitting along "single gene (validated/proven/driver)" vs. "polygenic or multi-program" diseases, with cancers being able to be put into BOTH of those categories, depending on the cancer. I am certain the same can be said for other diseases, such as rare monogenic metabolic diseases (e.g. Fabry's disease) or complex and common syndromes and diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus (both Types I and II).

Currently, most medications and treatments are directed at the average patient. Unfortunately, many people do not respond to the treatments that they are given.   changes this paradigm—The goal of   is to use molecular diagnostics to better understand individual variability at the genomic level and tailor treatments to each individual based on this information. It is all about getting the "right drug to the right patient at the right time". In Oncology, more patients are having their tumors sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing to identify potential drivers of their disease. There are many new targeted therapies that have been approved by the FDA and that are in clinical trials that are directed at these molecular targets and have shown improved efficacy, sometimes with very significant benefit. There are new diagnostic tests entering the market which will lead to additional ways of characterizing tumors and thus additional targets identified for drug development. This new approach has led to the novel clinical trial design and expedited approval of quite a few new therapies in oncology.

The   Initiative is an effort to help focus medical advances on a patient specific level by employing the latest genomic technologies including next generation sequencing technologies. Evidence based guidelines for assessing risk and providing management direction are often derived from data generated from large population based studies. Any health care provider, and in reality anyone who’s ever been a patient, understands that “one size does not fit all.” Within any study or patient population there will be individuals who respond or behave differently to treatment or fall outside the expected risk range for a particular condition.

The goal for   is to help further refine how we care for patients by taking advantage of the latest generation of technology. In reality, health care providers have always tried to personalized care at the patient level by incorporating “traditional factors” such as family history, but now, we are at the crossroads of potentially marrying traditional risk factors, which remain important, with that of information being ascertained in the genomics era.

  is an imprecise term that refers to individualizing patient care. The goal of tailoring care to the specific patient is to provide just enough of the right therapy for the individual and, ultimately, decreases side effects and increases success. Physicians in all fields of  have been individualizing patient care for many years. The genomic revolution has opened the door to a new way of individualizing care. Advances in molecular diagnostics based on new sequencing technologies allow us to assess all genes or a large set of genes of interest with one test. These new molecular diagnostics can use clinical samples or those specimens that remain after traditional clinical tests or pathology review are complete.  cancer  is treatment based on identifying key gene variants promoting growth and spread of the cancer occurring in the individual patient. The types of gene variants upon which treatment is based are mutations, copy number alterations and translocations.  cancer  makes use of what are often referred to as targeted therapies. These are smart drugs that specifically antagonize a key gene variant.

Following and echoing the other opinions, I would add that a very broad view of   would necessitate the use of *all* available data about a patient (and any patients like him/her) to tailor clinical management in the most focused way possible for that patient. This data increasingly will include 'omic profiling data (whole exome, genome, transcriptome, etc) on this patient, along with numerous other relevant parameters. The ability to generate entire genomes from patients in a prospective fashion has greatly enhanced the ability to expand how precise we can be in characterizing an individual patient, and we're now able to utilize these data in increasingly sophisticated ways to match patients to therapies that relate directly to the genetic events. This is currently very relevant in  cancer , where genetic mutations identified in patient tumor samples are directly impact treatment selection, and the expectation is that   principles will apply broadly across disease types.

 , also referred to as personalized  or individualized , is thought of as therapies that target a given disease as precisely as possible at a protein or molecular level e.g. above mentioned cancer therapies, enzyme replacement therapies for inborn errors of metabolism or ivacaftor for some CF patients. 
Yet, while we may understand a disease mechanism at a molecular level there are thousands of other genes that differ from one person to another. To be more “precise” one can look at the exome, genome, or transcriptome of a person. Even with that data,   is only roughly precise because we still interact with our environment which influences gene expression every day. Thus, what may be precise one day may not be precise another. To answer one of the above questions,   (Obama initiative) may bring novel therapies to market, but not in 1-2 yrs (drug development takes years) maybe in 10-15 yrs. And even then, until we better understand our genome as a whole and its interaction with our daily environment (food we eat, social interactions & other environmental factors) there is still a long way before  .
