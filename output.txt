  is often used interchangeably with personalized . The definition of both are not as tight as one would hope and mean slightly different thing to different people. The preference to use  rather than personalized seem to be getting stronger because it suggest that the right treatment will be chosen from among multiple option based on the detailed molecular nature of the disease. Some people feel that personalized  suggests that new therapy will be developed for each person, which is not typically going to happen.

Cancer is one of the best example of   because there are now many treatment directed at specific molecular target. They can be highly effective against cancer in which those gene are altered. Assigning a molecular basis to each person’s cancer allow more effective therapy than basing it on tissue of origin.

With monogenic disorder, the first goal is to identify the gene that cause the disease. This is more easily done now than it used to be because of the ability to examine the whole genome or exome. Once the gene and specific problem is known, decision on therapy, if any, can be made.

I'll help get this rolling - first, let's be lumper rather than splitter: I think our field is being more intellectually honest than ever before by admitting that a lot of  is "imprecise" or even "empiric", based on trial and error or observation rather than actual mechanism of health or disease. I would suggest that " " is a trendy colloquial term which refer to the linkage of medical care to a robust, deep, validated identification and targeting of the disease biology. I like the splitting along "single gene (validated/proven/driver)" vs. "polygenic or multi-program" disease, with cancer being able to be put into BOTH of those categorie, depending on the cancer. I am certain the same can be said for other diseases, such as rare monogenic metabolic diseases (e.g. Fabry's disease) or complex and common syndrome and diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus (both Types I and II).

Currently, most medication and treatment are directed at the average patient. Unfortunately, many people do not respond to the treatments that they are given.   change this paradigm—The goal of   is to use molecular diagnostic to better understand individual variability at the genomic level and tailor treatments to each individual based on this information. It is all about getting the "right drug to the right patient at the right time". In Oncology, more patient are having their tumor sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing to identify potential driver of their disease. There are many new targeted therapy that have been approved by the FDA and that are in clinical trial that are directed at these molecular target and have shown improved efficacy, sometimes with very significant benefit. There are new diagnostic test entering the market which will lead to additional way of characterizing tumors and thus additional targets identified for drug development. This new approach has led to the novel clinical trial design and expedited approval of quite a few new therapy in oncology.

The   Initiative is an effort to help focus medical advance on a patient specific level by employing the latest genomic technology including next generation sequencing technology. Evidence based guideline for assessing risk and providing management direction are often derived from data generated from large population based study. Any health care provider, and in reality anyone who’s ever been a patient, understand that “one size does not fit all.” Within any study or patient population there will be individual who respond or behave differently to treatment or fall outside the expected risk range for a particular condition.

The goal for   is to help further refine how we care for patient by taking advantage of the latest generation of technology. In reality, health care provider have alway tried to personalized care at the patient level by incorporating “traditional factor” such as family history, but now, we are at the crossroad of potentially marrying traditional risk factors, which remain important, with that of information being ascertained in the genomic era.

  is an imprecise term that refer to individualizing patient care. The goal of tailoring care to the specific patient is to provide just enough of the right therapy for the individual and, ultimately, decrease side effect and increase success. Physicians in all field of  have been individualizing patient care for many year. The genomic revolution has opened the door to a new way of individualizing care. Advances in molecular diagnostic based on new sequencing technology allow us to assess all gene or a large set of genes of interest with one test. These new molecular diagnostics can use clinical sample or those specimen that remain after traditional clinical test or pathology review are complete.  cancer  is treatment based on identifying key gene variant promoting growth and spread of the cancer occurring in the individual patient. The type of gene variants upon which treatment is based are mutation, copy number alteration and translocation.  cancer  make use of what are often referred to as targeted therapy. These are smart drug that specifically antagonize a key gene variant.

Following and echoing the other opinion, I would add that a very broad view of   would necessitate the use of *all* available data about a patient (and any patient like him/her) to tailor clinical management in the most focused way possible for that patient. This data increasingly will include 'omic profiling data (whole exome, genome, transcriptome, etc) on this patient, along with numerous other relevant parameter. The ability to generate entire genome from patients in a prospective fashion has greatly enhanced the ability to expand how precise we can be in characterizing an individual patient, and we're now able to utilize these data in increasingly sophisticated way to match patients to therapy that relate directly to the genetic event. This is currently very relevant in  cancer , where genetic mutation identified in patient tumor sample are directly impact treatment selection, and the expectation is that   principle will apply broadly across disease type.

 , also referred to as personalized  or individualized , is thought of as therapy that target a given disease as precisely as possible at a protein or molecular level e.g. above mentioned cancer therapy, enzyme replacement therapy for inborn error of metabolism or ivacaftor for some CF patient. 
Yet, while we may understand a disease mechanism at a molecular level there are thousand of other gene that differ from one person to another. To be more “precise” one can look at the exome, genome, or transcriptome of a person. Even with that data,   is only roughly precise because we still interact with our environment which influence gene expression every day. Thus, what may be precise one day may not be precise another. To answer one of the above question,   (Obama initiative) may bring novel therapy to market, but not in 1-2 yr (drug development take year) maybe in 10-15 yrs. And even then, until we better understand our genome as a whole and its interaction with our daily environment (food we eat, social interaction & other environmental factor) there is still a long way before  .

For year, the practice of  incorporate "personalized"
characteristic to be more "precise" in the treatment of patient that
include genetic, social, environmental, social factor. The movement
of " " is mainly driven by two technology: 1)
large-scale -omics profiling/diagnostic, and 2) targeted therapy.

1) With the first advance of microarray, there was the promise of
getting the fingerprint of each disease, esp in the area of cancer.
Most of those effort failed in being clinically relevant, with
notable exception of Genomic Health. Newest promise is now
next-generation sequencing, with panel, exome, and genome test for
genetic disease and cancer. However, just profiling is often not yet
sufficient for clinical relevance, and hence an active debate on the
current clinical usefulness of NGS.

2) Targeted therapy bolster the first technology. Depending on the
right genetic profile, there are difference drug that allow for
"precise" therapy. While these drug are still few and far between,
this promise of "precise drug" based on "precise diagnostic"
provide the impetus and dream of moving into  .
